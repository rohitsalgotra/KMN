# KMN
The Kepler's Meerkat Naked Algorithm (KMN)
This algorithm uses three algorithms namely Kepler's Optimization Algorithm (KOA), Meerkat Optimization algorithm (MOA) and Naked Mole-rat Algorithm (NMRA) as the basis.
The algorithm proposed uses the basic properties of these algorithms and hence a new multi-hybrid algorithm is proposed.
